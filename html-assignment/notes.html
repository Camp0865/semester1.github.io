        <dt>ID NAMES AND HOW TO USE THEM</dt>
        <dd>ID names are used to make a specific element have a unique ID name. This name can be selected and targeted specifically for CSS or HTML purposes. However, unlike its counterpart Classes, ID names MUST be unique. No two ID names can be the same.</dd>
        <dt>CLASSES</dt>
        <dd>Classes, much like ID names, are used to target specific elements on the page. However, a class is a group code- you can have more than one element reside under a single class. This makes it easy to change multiple elements at once, but using only a couple lines of code, rather than changing the code for them each individually.</dd>
        <dt>CSS LINK</dt>
        <dd>CSS can be done inline, internally, or externally. Inline is tedious and outdated. Internally, CSS can be inserted at the top into the head of the code via a style tag. However, this can be a nightmare to deal with, considering the CSS code would take up a huge amount of space. Let alone HTML code. The best way to insert CSS is via an external link, using the link tag. Make sure your .css file is either beside the targeted files, or within a subsequent relative path via a folder.</dd>
        <dt>INSERTING IMAGES</dt>
        <dd>Images can be inserted onto a page and manipulated via both HTML and CSS. However, while inline HTML width/ height manipulation can be done, it's not recommended. It's easier to use CSS to manipulate the dimensions, position, or other visual properties of the image.</dd>
        <dt>CASCADING PRIORITIIES</dt>
        <dd>When reading code, the computer reads it from top to bottom. So whatever is written under any code will override the code above it, if it is conflicting or similar code.</dd>
